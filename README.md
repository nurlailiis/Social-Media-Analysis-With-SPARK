# Social Media Analysis and Classification of Tweets Using SPARK
In this section I try to do project Twitter Sentiment Analysis. In this project, Sentiment Analysis Application is developed using Pyspark for only sneak peak the data, then for analysis, data preparation, visualization, modeling, and evaluation using Python. This application fetches Twitter data in live stream and classifies tweets into positive and negative categories. For sentiment classification of tweets, machine learning model (Voting Mechanism) has been developed. Sparkâ€™s ability to perform well on iterative algorithms makes it ideal for implementing machine learning techniques as, at their vast majority, machine learning algorithms are based on iterative jobs. Further, live visualization of results is done using Flask and Chart.js technology. Visualization gives the ability to combine data in order to create new insight.

## Get Started
1. The dataset using clean_tweet.csv file consist of data scraped from Twitter, contain text and target negative or positive
2. Analyze data using [CRISP-DM](https://www.sv-europe.com/crisp-dm-methodology/) methodology
4. Classification of Tweets to negative sentiment and positive sentiment
5. Visualization data
6. The image for word cloud visualization in fole image
7. Using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes for Modeling
